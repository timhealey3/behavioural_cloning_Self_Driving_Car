## Behavioural Cloning for Autonomous Cars


### running locally
First generate the Neural network model, in the terminal run src/main.py or main.py from the src file. This will create a model.keras in the SRC folder.
Then run drive.py, this will be our connection between our emulator and our code. The emulator can be downloaded from https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim?tab=readme-ov-file 
by scrolling down to "Available Game Builds" "Version 1, 12/09/16" then download the correct file for your OS. 

## YouTube video
I uploaded a video of the model working locally. I recommend watching it at 2x speed. The first track is the track the model was trained on, and the second track is completely new to the model. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzc95jP-JRI
