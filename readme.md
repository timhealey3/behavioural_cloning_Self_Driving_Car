### running locally
First generate the Neural network model, in the terminal run src/main.py or main.py from the src file. This will create a model.keras in the SRC folder.
Then run drive.py, this will be our connection between our emulator and our code. The emulator can be downloaded from https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim?tab=readme-ov-file 
by scrolling down to "Available Game Builds" "Version 1, 12/09/16" then download the correct file for your OS.
